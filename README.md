# 150Final

# Synopsis

This was a final for one of my classes back at Loyola. This is a simple script that takes in data (entered in by the user), and creates a line graph imagine (in .pdf form) and a spreadsheet (in .csv form).
This program can work with data that has up to 10 rows and 2 columns.  

The program works by having the user first input the number of columns (between 1 and 2). The user then inputs data row by row, column by column in that order.  This continues until the user declines to input another row or until the max number of rows is reached (10).  Afterwards, the program will begin to write a spreadsheet with the data the user just input.  When the user is ready, the program will then run the .R script which will take that spreadsheet and create a graph through RScript.

The purpose of this program was to learn how to create programs with mixed languages and utilizing different file formats interchangably. 

This program only runs on Windows OS

# Installation and Use

The user must have PythonFinalV4.py and RScriptV3.R in the same directory.  As of now, this program is not intended for use outside of my own personal computer.
